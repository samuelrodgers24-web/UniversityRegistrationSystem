# UniversityRegistrationSystem
This repository is an SQL project modeling a database designed for university course registration.

All work in this project is produced by Samuel Rodgers or Joshua Topp.

The project requirements come from a school project.
No information will be published that could link our work back to the course.
This is for the purpose of:
-  preserving the integrity of said course
-  keeping this repository public
